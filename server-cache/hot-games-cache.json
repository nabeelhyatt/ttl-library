      "description": "Nippon: Zaibatsu is a new edition of Nippon, a fast-paced, area-majority economic game. Players control &quot;zaibatsu&quot;: massive conglomerates of interconnected companies driving Japan's economy in the Industrial Revolution era.&#10;&#10;During the game, players invest in new industries, build factories and railroads, and produce goods to saturate local markets and fulfill contracts &mdash; all to grow their influence and power and to become rulers of the new modernized country. Players are free to choose their playstyle and winning strategy: They choose what they score victory points for, control the game's pace with income turns, and race each other to get the most beneficial factories, markets, and bonuses.&#10;&#10;All the core mechanisms of the original Nippon are present, but the components, art, and design are upgraded, and many gameplay features are reworked to get the game in line with modern trends. Nippon: Zaibatsu features new resource types, ships are heavily revised with new Iwakura mission rules, factories are much more variable, consolidation turns provide players with new rewards, and much more. Also, the game now has an automa-driven solo mode.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The Beast also has secret goals, and accomplishing them makes thwarting the scoundrels easier. Hollow Pact plays out this thrilling, treacherous chase, with no two sessions playing the same.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Constructed by the Ptolemaic dynasty, this institution became a hub for students, scribes, Scholars and Librarians, and great minds from diverse cultures. Ptolemy's dream was to amass the world's knowledge, and the library housed countless manuscripts, reflecting his Herculean effort to collect and preserve the intellectual heritage of the ancient world and gain renown to his name. The Great Library, situated near the bustling port of Alexandria, welcomed ships carrying relics, scholars, and the wisdom of distant lands. The Chief of Librarians played a pivotal role within the grand halls of the Mouseion, which housed not only the library but also other centers of learning and cultural exchange. They oversaw the organization of the vast collection, guided students through their training, and personally engaged in the art of translating and preserving texts from various languages, with a particular emphasis on Greek. The library's shelves whispered with the rustling of ancient parchment, embodying the spirit of intellectual curiosity and cross-cultural exchange.&#10;&#10;As players step into the sandals of Librarians in the Great Library, you take on the crucial responsibilities of leading the institution within the Mouseion, navigating the challenges and opportunities presented by this legendary center of knowledge. Amidst the relics, diverse minds, and bustling port activity, the Librarians became the primary custodians of knowledge, shaping the legacy of the Great Library and contributing to the rich tapestry of ancient history.&#10;&#10;The player with the most renown wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The Empire sends emissaries to foreign nations, brings technicians and scholars from the west, builds a network of railroads, and achieves an outstandingly fast industrial revolution.&#10;&#10;The nation and Emperor count on the support of the Great Four, the big conglomerates that emerge with great power and massive control over the Japanese economy. They are called Zaibatsu, and their influence on the Meiji Emperor and importance on the fate of Japan is incredibly high.&#10;&#10;Nippon is an Area Majority Game in which players control Zaibatsu and try to develop their web of power by investing in new industries, improving their technological knowledge, shipping goods to foreign countries or using them to satisfy local needs, and growing their influence and power as they oversee the era of rapid industrialization of Japan.&#10;&#10;The foundations of the big Zaibatsu were the traditional silk workshops, but soon the conglomerates diversified their influence and power, building a complex structure of interconnected companies that made them giant players in the world&rsquo;s new industrial era. Each player takes the reins of one of these big corporations and tries to develop it in order to grow and achieve power.&#10;&#10;To win the game, players must carefully choose which types of industry to invest in to get the most influence over the Japanese islands. Every action that is taken helps to forge their own path to new opportunities.&#10;&#10;Nippon is a fast-paced economic game with challenging decisions, set during an important time in Japanese history, and when a new great nation is born.&#10;&#10;",
