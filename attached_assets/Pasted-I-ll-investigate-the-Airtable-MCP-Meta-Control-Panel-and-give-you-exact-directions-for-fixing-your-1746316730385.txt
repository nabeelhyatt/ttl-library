I'll investigate the Airtable MCP (Meta Control Panel) and give you exact directions for fixing your vote recording issue. First, I need to check the Airtable structure to understand your specific implementation.

Now I'll examine the tables in your Airtable base:

Now let me check the Votes table structure in more detail:

Let's examine the Games table structure to better understand how we need to link to it:

Now let's check the Members table structure to understand how to link users:

Let's look at some existing votes to understand the format and structure:

Now I have a good understanding of your Airtable structure. Based on my analysis, I can give you exact directions to properly record a vote in your Airtable database.

## The Issue

The problem is in how the linked records are being formatted in your API request. When creating a vote record in Airtable, you need to:

1. Properly structure linked record fields as arrays of record IDs
2. Ensure you're using the correct field names exactly as they appear in Airtable

## Exact Directions

Here's the exact Airtable API request structure you need to use to record a vote:

```javascript
// Replace these values with your actual API key and base ID
const AIRTABLE_API_KEY = 'your_api_key';
const AIRTABLE_BASE_ID = 'app5ba31NSaWtrCXd';

// Function to create a vote in Airtable
async function createVoteInAirtable(memberId, gameId, voteType) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.airtable.com/v0/${AIRTABLE_BASE_ID}/Votes`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${AIRTABLE_API_KEY}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        fields: {
          // CRITICAL: Member and Game fields must be arrays of record IDs
          "Member": [memberId],      // Member record ID from tblF8zJQvztoqbQnI
          "Game": [gameId],          // Game record ID from tbl1OXpQn4tj19S9P
          "Vote Type": voteType      // One of the predefined values in your select field
        }
      })
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    console.log('Vote created successfully:', data);
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating vote in Airtable:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}

// Example usage
// createVoteInAirtable('recXXXXXXXXX', 'recYYYYYYYYY', 'Want to try');
```

## Important Notes

1. **Field Names**: The field names must exactly match what's in your Airtable (`"Member"`, `"Game"`, and `"Vote Type"`).

2. **Record IDs**: You need to use the actual Airtable record IDs (starting with "rec") for both Member and Game, not just the BGG ID or other identifier.

3. **Linked Records Format**: Even though your linked fields have `"prefersSingleRecordLink": true`, they must still be passed as arrays in the API request (`[recordId]`).

4. **Vote Type**: This must be one of the exact values from your single select field: "Want to try", "Played, again!", "Join club", "Tournament", or "Would teach".

5. **Content-Type Header**: Ensure your request includes the proper `Content-Type: application/json` header.

6. **Authorization**: Make sure you're using the complete, unchanged API key in your `Authorization` header.

If you're having issues getting the correct record IDs, you may need to:

1. First look up the game by BGG ID
2. Get its Airtable record ID
3. Then create the vote with that record ID

Would you like me to provide additional code examples for this lookup process as well?
