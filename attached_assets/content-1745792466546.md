Tabletop Library is a membership-based board game club opening soon in South Berkeley, next to Star Market on Claremont Ave.

Join our weekly learn-to-play sessions, monthly tournaments, and special themed game nights. Play classic strategy games like chess and mahjong, or modern hits like Wingspan and Everdell, plus community nights like speed puzzling and social deduction. Discover the latest games and find a new favorite.

Members can play with their friends, or use our concierge service to arrange games on-demand with other members. We're building Tabletop Library as a third place for anyone interested in using games as an excuse to get out of the house.
