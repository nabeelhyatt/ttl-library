I understand it's not a permissions issue since you have total access to everything. Let's dig deeper into technical issues that could cause a 403 "NOT_AUTHORIZED" error with Airtable despite having proper permissions.
Here are other potential problems to investigate:

API Token Issues:

The token might be malformed when being sent to Airtable
There might be encoding issues with the token (especially if it contains special characters)
The token might be getting truncated somewhere in your application


Base ID or Table ID Issues:

Check if the Base ID being used in your code matches exactly with your actual Airtable base
Verify that table IDs/names are exactly correct - even a slight mismatch can cause errors


Request Format Problems:

The format of your request payload might not match what Airtable expects
Check if there are any required headers missing in your API calls


Rate Limiting:

Airtable could be returning a 403 if you've hit rate limits
Check if other write operations to Airtable are working at all


Environment Variable Issues:

The environment variables for Airtable credentials might not be properly loaded
There could be whitespace or invisible characters in your environment variables


Field Validation Issues:

Airtable might be rejecting writes due to field validation failures
Check if any fields have specific validation rules (like unique constraints)


Schema Changes:

If your Airtable schema was recently changed, your code might be using outdated field names


Authentication Chain:

Your server might be using a different authentication flow than expected
The token might be getting overwritten or modified during the request lifecycle



Let's add some debug code to isolate exactly where the failure is occurring. Here's what I suggest trying:

Add verbose logging to print out:

The exact API token being used (first few/last few chars for security)
The exact Base ID being used
The complete request payload being sent to Airtable
All headers being sent with the request


Try a simple test write to Airtable using a different table (maybe create a test table) to see if that works
Check the Airtable API documentation to ensure your requests are formatted correctly according to the latest API version
Try using the Airtable API directly (via curl or Postman) with the same credentials to isolate if it's a code issue or an API issue

This appears to be a technical issue with how your application is interfacing with Airtable rather than a permissions problem. The error message "You are not authorized to perform this operation" from Airtable is unfortunately generic and can be triggered by various issues beyond just permissions.
