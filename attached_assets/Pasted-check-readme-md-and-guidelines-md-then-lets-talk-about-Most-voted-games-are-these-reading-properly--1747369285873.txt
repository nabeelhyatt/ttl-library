Let me look at the rankings page code and check how the "Most Voted Games" section is implemented. I'll also examine the server-side code to understand how this data is being fetched from Airtable.


Searched for "Find the implementation for fetching most voted games from Airtable, especially in client/src/pages/rankings.tsx and related API route implementations"
I've looked at the code and found the issue with the "Most Voted Games" section. The error logs show that when fetching data from Airtable, we're getting an error: "Unknown field name: \"Total Votes\"". This indicates that the field name we're trying to access doesn't exist in the Airtable database.

Looking at the code in server/services/airtable-direct.ts, the getMostVotedGames() function is trying to sort by a field called "Total Votes", but based on the logs, this field name doesn't exist in your Airtable base.

However, I see in the logs that there is a field called "# Votes" in your Airtable base. This is likely the field we should be using instead of "Total Votes".

Let me fix this issue by updating the field name in the Airtable service:


Opened server/services/airtable-direct.ts
I'll need to check the getMostVotedGames and getCategoryVotes functions in the Airtable service to fix the field name issue. I'll search for those in the file:


Executed grep -n "getMostVotedGames\|getCategoryVotes" server/services/airtable-direct.ts
Now I'll view the getMostVotedGames and getCategoryVotes functions to fix the incorrect field names:


Opened server/services/airtable-direct.ts
Now I'll check the getCategoryVotes function as well:


Opened server/services/airtable-direct.ts
I've examined the code and found the issue causing the "Most Voted Games" and category data not to display correctly. The problem is in the field names being used to query Airtable.

According to the server logs, we're getting an error: Unknown field name: "Total Votes" when trying to fetch data. However, looking at the logs for an existing game's fields, I can see there's a field called "# Votes" that likely contains the vote count data we need.
